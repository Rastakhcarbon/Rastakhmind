## Overview

Rastakh Digital Ledger is a standards-driven, zero-dependency, culturally-aware digital ledger designed to represent time and records using the Solar Hijri (Persian / Jalaali) calendar natively via browser Intl APIs. The project prioritizes transparency, auditability, and long-term maintainability by relying on standardized platform capabilities rather than third-party libraries or custom calendar math.
